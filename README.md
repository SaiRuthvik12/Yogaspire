# Yogaspire
## Description
Yogaspire is an AI yoga trainer who helps the user to correct their yoga poses and help the user to do the poses in a right way. Yogaspire also personalises the yoga routine for the user, suggesting them the daily hours they should be investing in doing yoga on the daily basis for their physical and mental improvement.  

The program uses Mediapipe pose detection for getting the landmarks of different parts of the body and calculates angles between different parts to confirm if a yoga pose is done correctly.
